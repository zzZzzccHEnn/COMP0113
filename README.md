## Introduction:
This is a VR collaborative Drawing game developed for the coursework of [COMP0113: Virtual Environments, https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=29949]

This is a social VR platform allows multiple users to draw together, they can have sketch for discussion and play the draw-and-guss game. This project integrate the Ubiq package to enable the social VR feature. Users can use the spawn panel to spawn some markers. Then the users can grasp a marker (middle finger trigger) and start painting (index finger trigger). When drawing the users must let the tip of the marker touch the whiteboard, just like in the real world. We have also introduced an eraser, which can be used from the spawn panel, to help make drawing more efficient.
